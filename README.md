### Planning Story

I began by brainstorming an idea to combine mental health and tech. Reach Out is an application that users can use to keep track of mental health counselors that they come accross that they would like to stock pile as their own personal database. Reach Out allows users to `CRUD` onto `counselors`. The first steps to accomplishing version one (V1) of Reach Out was to make an ERD and a wireframe. Afterwards, I connected the Django API back-end with the React Auth front-end and began coding in the `CRUD` routes and end-points for the `counselors`. By testing each `CRUD` command and using `console.log()` every step of the way, I verified the applications functionality. It has a long way to go before it is completed but this is the MVP of Reach Out's V1.
